The efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm are two important indicators of its performance:
	1) The optimal estimation algorithm, represented by a Kalman filter, represents an obvious progress in
terms of the LIB (lithium-ion battery - shows obvious nonlinear dynamic characteristics) state estimation
		- Important parameters in the equivalent model, such as polarization resistance, capacitance.
		-  unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which are algorithms developed based on the Kalman filter, better solve the state estimation problems
for the nonlinear LIB.

	 (1) considering the OCV not as a state variable existing in dynamic equations but as an intermediate quantity existing in 
		a measurement equation; therefore, a reasonably big measurement noise (covariance) can be chosen to make the filter
		not trust OCV excessively.
	(2) Using the Coulomb integral equation (CIE) in the dynamic equations, and using the SOC as one of the state variables, 
		thus, by the use of a smaller system noise (covariance)

Still there is a problem, the obvious nonlinear of the SOC-OCV curve makes the model construction
very difficult. Therefore, represented by the EKF  (Extended Kalman filter) method, complex methods are developing. Adopting
these complex algorithms, the nonlinear problems are partially solved, and the problems of time varying
parameters are also solved.

SOC is commonly defined as “the percentage of the maximum possible charge that is present insidea rechargeable battery”

SOCt = SOC0 - 1/C (integral t - 0) idt
	- SOC0 is the initial value of SOC
	- SOCt is the present value of SOC
	- C is the total capacity of the battery
	- integral(t-0)idt is the integral of discharge current during the discharge process

Equivalent Circuit Model  -> The Dual Polarization (DP) model is adopted: uL = uOC -iR0 -uPA uPC

A function of SOC-OCV [14] can be represented as: uOC = u(SOC,y) = y*SOC + bU
	y:  slope of the data point on the SOC-OCV curve
	bU:  has a correlation with SOC, which is one of the state variables of dynamic equation
